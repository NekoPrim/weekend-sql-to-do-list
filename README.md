## Description

Created an API to-do list.  The front end has a tasks input area. When a new task is entered, it is added to the database and posted to the DOM. Each task has the option to be completed or deleted. If a task is completed, it will update to a green background with a check mark. If the option delete is selected, the task will be removed from the DOM and database.
